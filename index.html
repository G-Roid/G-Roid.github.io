	<h3 id="hungry-cat">The Hungry Cat</h3>
	
	<p class="cat-story"> A hungry cat is looking for something to eat. She sees a little grey mouse sitting near his house.<br>

		- I want to catch that little mouse, - says the hungry cat.<br>

		She sits down and begins to cry "mew, mew, mew".<br>

		The little grey mouse jumps up to run into his house, but the cat sits still and mews again.<br>
		- She is sitting still, - thinks the mouse.<br>
		- She doesn't want to catch me. I shall not run away.<br>
		- Mew, mew, mew, - says the cat again. <br>
		- Why are you crying? - asks the mouse.<br>
		- See, I have a penny in my hand.<br>
		- Good, you are lucky. That's nothing to cry about, - says the mouse.<br>
		The hungry cat comes nearer.<br>
		- Oh, little mouse, I shall get some meat with the penny. I shall cook it and have it for supper.<br>
		- Good, you are lucky. That's nothing to cry about.<br>
		The hungry cat comes nearer and nearer.<br>
		- There lives a hungry dog in this house. He will eat all the meat.<br>
		- Poor Pussy, - says the mouse. - What will you eat then?<br>
		- You, - cries the cat and jumps at the little grey mouse.<br>
		But the mouse is too quick. He jumps into his little house before the cat can say another "mew".<br>
		- No, no, sly Pussy, - says the mouse. - <span id="moral">You will not eat me. You must first catch me.</span> <br>
