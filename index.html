    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    
    <p id="aboutmainecoons">Maine Coons are <strong>enormous</strong> creatures with soft paws and puffy tails, and they scare tiney mice away from your home.<br>
	They eat the most fresh vegetables however, they much prefer <em> cat food </em>. Incredibly 	<strong>they love swimming <em>everywhere.</em></strong>.</p>
    
	<div id="why-sidebar">
		<h4> Why Are Maine Coons So Large?</h4>
		<p> Maine Coons are big because breeders have selectively bred from large cats for many years. That means selecting large cats and mating them over and over again.<br>
		The original cats were large too. These cats were probably long haired cats from England that came over with the settlers in the 1600s.<br>
		The answer as to why Maine Coons are so big, the biggest domestic cat registered by the Cat Fanciers' Association, is because the starting cats were large and through careful cat breeding they have been made larger. <br>
		Large cats have a greater likelihood of suffering from cat health issues such as hip dysplasia. <br>
		Miniature cats are bred small in the same way but by selecting small cats<br>

	<h3>Cat Care Essentials</h3>
	<p id="Caring for Your Maine Coon"> Despite the length of the Maine Coon’s coat, it has a silky texture that doesn’t mat easily—if you groom it regularly.<br>
	It is easily cared for with twice weekly combing to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Useful grooming tools include a stainless steel comb for removing tangles and what’s called a grooming rake to pull out dead undercoat, which is what causes tangles when it’s not removed. <br>
	Use it gently, especially in the stomach area and on the tail. Maine Coons are patient, but they don’t like having their hair pulled any more than you do. Check the tail for bits of poop stuck to the fur and clean it off with a baby wipe.<br>
	<br> <img id="garfield-pic" src="http://fandomania.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/garfield.jpg">
	Bathe a Maine Coon as needed, which can range from every few weeks to every few months. If his coat feels greasy or his fur looks stringy, he needs a bath. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. <br>
	<br>
	Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection.<br>
	<br>
	Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear. Keep the Maine Coon’s litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will help to keep the coat clean as well.<br>
	<br>
	It’s a good idea to keep a Maine Coon as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Maine Coons who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.<br>

	<h2>A Fable of Felines</h2>
	
	<h3 id="hungry-cat">The Hungry Cat</h3>
	
	<p class="cat-story"> A hungry cat is looking for something to eat. She sees a little grey mouse sitting near his house.<br>

		- I want to catch that little mouse, - says the hungry cat.<br>

		She sits down and begins to cry "mew, mew, mew".<br>

		The little grey mouse jumps up to run into his house, but the cat sits still and mews again.<br>
		- She is sitting still, - thinks the mouse.<br>
		- She doesn't want to catch me. I shall not run away.<br>
		- Mew, mew, mew, - says the cat again. <br>
		- Why are you crying? - asks the mouse.<br>
		- See, I have a penny in my hand.<br>
		- Good, you are lucky. That's nothing to cry about, - says the mouse.<br>
		The hungry cat comes nearer.<br>
		- Oh, little mouse, I shall get some meat with the penny. I shall cook it and have it for supper.<br>
		- Good, you are lucky. That's nothing to cry about.<br>
		The hungry cat comes nearer and nearer.<br>
		- There lives a hungry dog in this house. He will eat all the meat.<br>
		- Poor Pussy, - says the mouse. - What will you eat then?<br>
		- You, - cries the cat and jumps at the little grey mouse.<br>
		But the mouse is too quick. He jumps into his little house before the cat can say another "mew".<br>
		- No, no, sly Pussy, - says the mouse. - <span id="moral">You will not eat me. You must first catch me.</span> <br>

	<h2>Cat Facts</h2>
		<p class="fact warning">     <!-- Multiple Class -->
			Warning: owning multiple cats can have adverse effects on your heath. Please consult your doctor if problems persist.
		</p class="fact">
		Cats have a reflective layer in their eyes, known as the tapetum lucidum, which magnifies incoming light allowing them to see up to 6 times better than humans can in low light.
		Cats (as well as dogs) also have a ‘third eyelid’ called the <strong class="warning">nictitating membrane </strong> which is found on the inside corner of the eye which is an extra protective function of the eye.
		</p>
		
		<p class="fact">
		Cats can be trained. Teach your cat to share a “high five” with you by rewarding her with a special treat every time she lifts her paw.
		</p>
		
		<p class="fact">
		Cats have 32 muscles in their ears (humans have only 12). This gives the ear mobility, enabling it to precisely locate prey such as mice or the opening of their cat food! Cats can also hear frequencies that are both below and above those that can be heard by humans.
		The ear also has the job of helping to maintain balance and the ability to right themselves when falling – which is where the phrase “Cats always land on their feet” came from.
